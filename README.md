### About 
This is a website I created for my second client. I was asked to both design and write it. I went for a minimalistic, clean and straightforward style.<br/><br/>
As the client asked for a simple website that would inform about the services offered in a clear and easy way, I created a one-page website divided into three sections: presentation of services offered, short information about the company, and a contact form. I also made a separate page with a photo gallery of their 
previous renovation projects.<br/><br/>
I connected the form to the client's email address with Emailjs, using the instructions provided on their website. I finished everything with reCaptcha to protect the e-mail from unnecessary spam.
